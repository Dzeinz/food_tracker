# Food Tracker
Demo project created for Club Automation to demonstrate development ability and highlight SOLID coding principles.

The Food Tracker application allows you to search an external foods database (USDA - https://ndb.nal.usda.gov) to retrieve a list of food items.  Selections from that list can then be added to a cart, where the total caloric content is displayed.
